 Food Spoilage Prediction
This project predicts whether a food item is fresh or spoiled based on its properties using machine learning. It helps in reducing food waste, improving safety, and optimizing inventory management for food suppliers, retailers, and households.

 Features
Predicts freshness or spoilage from food data.

Uses machine learning models for classification.

Supports multiple input features such as temperature, humidity, storage time, and more.

Can be extended for real-time prediction using IoT sensors.

 Dataset
The dataset contains features like:

Temperature (Â°C) â€“ Storage temperature of the food item.

Humidity (%) â€“ Environmental moisture level.

pH Level â€“ Acidity or alkalinity of the food.

Storage Time (days) â€“ Duration since storage.

Gas Emission Levels â€“ COâ‚‚ / Ethylene levels from packaging.

Visual Quality â€“ Color changes or spots (if available).

Target Variable:

0 â†’ Fresh

1 â†’ Spoiled
